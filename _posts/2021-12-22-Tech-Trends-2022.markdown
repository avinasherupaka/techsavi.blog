It is critical to stay current with industry trends in order to solve problems in a dynamic business ecosystem. From DevSecOps to low-code apps, software development trends change as quickly as technology itself. Here, I will categorize trends across following technology disciplines.

1.	Software Engineering/Development
2.	Cloud Computing
3.	Data
4.	Architecture
5.	Integration
6.	Automation
7.	Data Science, AI, ML
8.	IoT
9.	BlockChain
10.	AR/VR
11.	Cyber Security
