In today's world, where self-service business intelligence reigns supreme, every business strives to establish itself as an data-driven business. Many businesses are aware of the numerous advantages gained from using leverage to make informed decisions. The ability to provide superior, highly personalized services to customers while reducing costs and capital is the most appealing.

However, businesses continue to face a number of challenges in transitioning to a data-driven strategy and realizing its full potential. While transferring legacy systems, avoiding legacy culture, and prioritizing data management in an ever-changing set of business needs are all legitimate challenges, the data platform's architecture is also a major impediment.

The capacity of siloed data warehouses and data lake architectures to support an instantaneous stream of data is limited. As a result, they undermine organizations' scalability and democratization goals. However, Enterprise Data Mesh(EDM) - a revolutionary, new architectural paradigm geared to accelerate an organization data journey.

The EDM's are emerging as a distinct and compelling method of managing data within an organization. It brings "product thinking" to enterprise data management while enabling new levels of enterprise agility and data governance. It also creates a "self-service" capability with near real-time data synchronization, laying the groundwork for real-time digital enterprises.

An EDM is made up of numerous components (lots more detail available here, here, and here). Data Products, the primary building block of a Data Mesh, contain operational, analytic, and/or engagement data that is synchronized across an organization via an Enterprise's Data Mesh. APIs are used to gain access to data contained within a Data Product. Each Data Product contains an audit log that records data changes and a catalog of data it manages to support federated governance.

There are numerous Data Products in an Enterprise's Data Mesh. When one Data Product changes its data, this change is communicated to other Data Products via Change Data Capture and an Event Streaming Backbone.


Cheers and Happy Coding ðŸ¤˜
