# What is IoT ?

>**Internet of Things(IoT)** is the concept where physical things(Human, Car, hammer) are augmented with connectivity, sensing and computational capability enabling them to transfer data over a network without requiring human intervention.

# Why is IoT important?

>IoT enables a deployed entity to sense, communicate and collaborate, creating a **robust** outcome that brings immediate **value** to the users.

Lets see what IoT has to offer a household user. Lets take example of a smart temperature control unit (like nest). When you deploy it in your home, it enables you to:

1. Monitor and Control the device and its application **REMOTELY**
2. Use the parameter (in this case electricity) efficiently
3. Improve service life of peripherals involved(as usage is efficeint)
4. Connectivity and collaboration with other devices/capabilities
5. Autonomy of things

At the same time lets see, how this device can help its manufacturers:

1. Real time metrics on device condition, usage and performance
2. Provide data to build real time analytics to guide business decisions
3. Provide insights and opportunity to monetize eco-system services which in-turn add value.
4. Product enhancements and re-designs
5. Patch Software updates **REMOTELY**

# Classification of IoT

IoT can be classified into 3 broad categories.

1. Consumer IoT

> This includes personal and household monitoring. Smart devices like temperature controls, kitchen appliances, lights, windows etc can be connected. Concepts like connected people, smart homes, smart buildings fall in this segment

2. Industrial/Large-Scale IoT

> This includes connectivity between different large scale machines. Making process product making or service more informed and robust. Concepts like Connected products, Connected fleets, Connected infrastructures fall in this segment

3. Civic IoT

> This includes smart public services like transportation, household amenities(water, electricity, weather etc.).
Connected infrastructures, Connected markets fall in this segment

# WORK IN PROGRESS

Cheers and Happy Coding ðŸ¤˜
