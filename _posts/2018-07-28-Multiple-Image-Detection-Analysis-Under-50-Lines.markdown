Everything around us today is getting Artificially Intelligent. Whether it is a social media website that can detect your friends from a picture or a self driving car. Such great inventions are happening because of advancements in AI and its eco-system. Computer vision is one such important fields in Artificial Intelligence.

Object detection is one of the most profound aspect of computer vision due the number practical use cases. For example Face detection, People Counting, Vehicle detection, Aerial image analysis, security, etc. With recent advancements in deep learning based computer vision models , object detection applications are easier to develop than ever before. In this tutorial, I will briefly introduce the concept of object detection and a live abstract demonstration of its application.

From a developer standpoint building modern object detection application and models is not a straight forward task. However companies like Google, Facebook, NVIDIA, Honeywell etc ([more companies](http://www.lengrand.fr/computer-vision-companies/)) are doing extensive research and open sourcing their findings in the form of datasets and algorithms. Of course there is also a great pool open-source community contributions like, [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) on of the popular computer vision library. Other most popular object detection algorithms/methods are R-CNN, Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN, RetinaNet, SSD and YOLO. However, these classical algorithms could not achieve enough performance in all cases, for variety of reasons:

1. Varying conditions
2. Variable number of objects
3. Sizing
4. Modeling

Alright enough of theory, lets build an image predictions application !

### Test Images:

```

Above is the aggregate set of predictions by which you can develop interested analytical and decision models. Data of this kind has endless application.

We can then further analyze or process these images to pin point distinct attributes. For example:

![child-dog]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/child-dog.jpg)

### Result of object Detection:

## My vision:
One real time application, I can associate with my field of work (ag-tech/ag-science) is, a drone flying over a farm, capturing real-time crop pictures(corn for exmaple), running through a model to detect anomalies and alert the farmer keeping him informed and ahead of the game. In addition to that we will be capturing myriad of data which can then be utilized for R&D purposes.

## Conclusion
The applications of computer vision, object detection , image predictions are numerous. I am anticipating more research and applications in these field, shaping variety of domains like security, agriculture, manufacturing, terrain analysis, rescue drones etc !  

Cheers and Happy Coding ðŸ¤˜
