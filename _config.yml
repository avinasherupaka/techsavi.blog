about-author: My name is Avinash Erupaka. Iâ€™ve been passionately developing software for the past 9+ years. I enjoy building fast, responsive, intuitive, dynamic and robust web/mobile application for both small and enterprise scale. I have proficiency using tools like React.js, Redux, Bootstrap, Material Design for the front end. Node.js, Scala, Clojure and Java for the back end. Over the years I have built a lot of stuff including web sites and services, systems integrations, data platforms. I currently work as Sr Software Developer for Bayer Crop Science. Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer, etc.
