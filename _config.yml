about-author: My name is Avinash Erupaka. I’ve been passionately developing software for the past six years. I love speaking, traveling, and boxing. I enjoy building fast, responsive, intuitive, dynamic and robust web or mobile application for both small and enterprise scale. I have proficiency using tools like React.js, Redux, Bootstrap, Material Design for the front end. Node.js, Scala, Clojure and Java for the back end. I leverage AWS as a cloud provider and I am an AWS Certified Developer - Associate.
